# Per RHEL's documentation, the direct use of libcgroup to mange cgroups are
# deprecated since RHEL7, and systemd is recommended to mange cgroups (ref 1).
# However, the current feature what systemd is offering is really limitted,
# which does't support cpuset limit (ref 2). Therefore, the tranditional way
# for managing cgroups is still used.
